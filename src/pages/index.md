Opportunities abound for building for After Effects. Extend the capabilities of After Effects using plug-ins, scripts, and panels that integrate seamlessly into existing workflows. Create stunning visual effects, manipulate project elements, and automate complex tasks using After Effects APIs.

#### Automate complex workflows

Automate After Effects using scripts that run from a menu item or the command line. Add new panels that dock and resize within the After Effects UI. Streamline how media is managed. Simplify the search and ingest of source media, and automate tedious and error-prone steps for final delivery.

### Build stunning visual effects

Start with a wide variety of built-in parameter controls and data types, or build your own. Support image buffers with color depths from 8-bit to 32-bit floating point. Set parameter dependencies, and even change project elements based on parameter settings. Effects built using the plug-in SDK can be made compatible with Premiere Pro.

### Integrate other tools in your workflow

Artists love After Effects not only for what can be done in the application, but for how it connects to other tools in their workflow. Are you thinking of a new way for After Effects to work with other tools? Panels, scripts, and the command-line interface can help you make that connection.
